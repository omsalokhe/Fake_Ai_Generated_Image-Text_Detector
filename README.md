# Fake_Ai_Generated_Image-Text_Detector
A machine learning–based system to detect AI-generated images and videos using deep learning models, helping identify synthetic and manipulated media.Built with Python, deep learning models, and a focus on real-world media authenticity.

Project Overview

AI Content Detector is a Streamlit-based web application that identifies whether an image or text is AI-generated or human-created.
The project combines computer vision, deep learning, and linguistic heuristics, with special support for Indian languages.
This project was built to address the growing challenge of deepfakes and AI-generated content, especially in digital media and online platforms.

Key Features:

🖼 Image Detection
  Detects AI-generated vs real images
  Two analysis modes:
    Heuristic-based analysis (image size, aspect ratio, color distribution)
    Deep Learning analysis using a custom CNN (PyTorch)
  Displays confidence scores and final verdict

📝 Multi-Lingual Text Detection
  Detects AI-written vs human-written text
  Supports 22+ Indian languages
  Automatic language detection
  Advanced text metrics:
  Perplexity
  Burstiness
  Syntactic complexity
  Detailed AI & human writing indicators
